# Quantum Computing UK Repository

This repository contains all of the Qiskit code found in the quantum computing tutorials at : https://quantumcomputinguk.org. 

It is divided in to the following folders: 

- Basic: Low level programs such as demonstration of quantum logic gates
- Advanced: More advanced algorithms such as Shors, Grovers, Quantum Fourier Transform etc
- Quantum Error Correction: Programs concerning quantum error correction
- Quantum Machine Learning: Machine learning examples such as Quantum Support Vector Machine (QSVM)

Note: If you find this repository useful then give it a Star!
